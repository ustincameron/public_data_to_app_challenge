Good selection of books. For the most part nice staff but one experience left me going elsewhere. I had checked out a large number of books, and spent hours going through them marking important pages for my work. When I returned the books to the library, I scanned in the pages marked to be sent to my email to avoid having to waste paper on printing everything. I followed the instructions of the staff to a T in doing this so as not to lose all my work. I had done the same with pictures by myself another time but with only one page. I was told to hit the send at the end and then told it should be in my mailbox. It never appeared though I had double checked the address and followed instructions at all steps. I was ensured before completing that everything should be in my inbox. The staff reported they did not know what happened but were sorry and asked me if I wanted to check out all the books again. I said no as I had spent alot of time doing that work and don't have that kind of time to throw away. It was the same staff who when I had printed my tax return out there, had looked at it with another staff member with no reason to do so.

I checked in two books on the 21st. That same visit I purchased books for our neighborhood “take a book/return a book” stand.\n\nToday I go in to use the computers and was locked out. Upon speaking to the front desk I found that I am being charged $31 for a missing book cover. Please note that said book did not have a cover when I checked it out. I am then asked to describe the attendant who checked the book out to me originally (11/7). I sure hope I have an accurate description because as any educated person knows, the time lapsed has been so long, I may have added details to the woman.\n\nMoving on, I get to speak to the *assistant director* who begins questioning me. I explain that I would not have damage the book. I am a 28 year old professional and understand taking care of lent items quite well. She insists that the book would have NEVER been checked out without a cover, which to me is accusatory seeing as I just explained that it in fact was.\n\nLong story long, I am now waiting to receive a call back after they conduct the hunt for the “nonpolicy following employee”. At the risk of costing someone their job based on a casual description I almost wish I would have paid the fee for a replacement book.\n\nLove the environment and the book selection.

The only Carnegie Library that doesn’t bear the philanthropists name (Turns out union busting and cole miners aren’t a good mix.), the structure is a marvel of early Americana. When my son was small, it was important to teach him the value of low-cost experiences over buying expensive things. PBS, public libraries, and NPR provided such a refuge for my family and I. (Did I mention that my son was the first person in his school to earn 1,000 AR points? Proud parents!) From the mix of newer  murals and artwork to the carefully preserved original features, many public institutions provide a quiet stillness not readily available in our hectic lives. We’ve never had a bad experience: the director is warm and engaging, the staff’s enthusiasm is contagious, and the used book sales are amazing. Have you seen the Alice in Wonderland theme in the children’s library? We now live in Kansas City, and haven’t experienced anything like it in a community that is only 1% of the KC metro area. If you do nothing else, visit often and donate generously. Even $5-10 per month can mean the difference between continuing or canceling important community programs. Since I first experienced the beauty of poetry here, I’ll end with a haiku heard on NPR just this morning: Set a reading goal, Library trips twice a week, How much can I read? —Jancee Tabacnic, Richmond, KY","time":1561990842},{"author_name":"Surgans “Bigdaddy5024” Gaming","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111827823040470253294/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhYj4GaNsFPN1j0JdEpEdr5kqEwAoKrlDWlVIbUMg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Wrong Library, great people!

I returned a book in January.  I received a call,  saying one of the pages had been ripped all the way through.  I checked all the books before returning them and they had been intact.  I told the woman so.  She said okay and hung up.  I go in 3 months later and they say i have a $20.49 balance on my account for not returning a book.  I say i did return it.  They can't find it,  then someone pulls it from behind the counter saying it was damaged and i have to pay for it. The damage is a page ripped all the way through and taped.  Again,  i tell them i was not responsible.  The tape used is not the kind of tape we have in our house.  It is also not taped as i tape books.  I always tape over the edge,  wrapping around back and front for support.  The employee said uh huh, okay,  and yeah,  and charged me $20+ for a book that was pencil marked,  ripped,  taped and heavily used that we did not damage.  I realize people lie,  but it is unfortunate that honest customers have to pay,  when very possibly an employee ripped it,  taped it and then blamed it on the last person to have it.\n\nI am updating this review, at the suggestion of a library employee .  In the disagreement above,  I emailed the library manager and she said they would \"review procedures and policies to make sure such things didn't happen again\". Yesterday, July 26, 2019, I picked up an Emilie Loring book. The first page was written in and two pages have been torn in half with the upper half missing.  I was afraid that they were going to accuse me of doing the damage again,  so I called them first thing this morning.  The employee I spoke with at least appeared to believe me,  but the only suggestion she had to give was to post this in a review.  Obviously,  the books are still not being checked thoroughly,  obviously reviewing procedures haven't eliminated the possibility of an innocent party having to pay for a destroyed book.  Please,  take action library manager! I enjoy your library, I only visit it a couple times a year,  but I detest being made to pay for books that I do not ruin every time I check a bunch out!","time":1564238719}],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=4829175295682101869","website":"http://home.oct.net/pwrlad/"},{"formatted_address":"106 N Union Ave, Stafford, KS 67578, USA","formatted_phone_number":"(620) 234-5762","geometry":{"location":{"lat":37.96236999999999,"lng":-98.6015845},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":37.9637171802915,"lng":-98.60032131970848},"southwest":{"lat":37.9610192197085,"lng":-98.6030192802915}}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/v1/png_71/school-71.png","name":"Nora E.
